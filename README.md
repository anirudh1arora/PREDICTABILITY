# PREDICTABILITY
Diesel price prediction for a trucking company  
Implemented a NoSQL/JSONIQ application to assist a trucking company to increase their profit margin by selecting between futures or
options of fuel prices.
The decision was based on predicted future prices generated stochastically, using randomness in historical data.
Additionally provided monthly, quarterly and yearly predicted fuel prices for the given time frame.
